# Octaglyph

Octaglyph - a text entry method with minimal space requirements.

Provides a text entry method with minimal requirements, namely, eight 'directional' sensors and one or two buttons for acceptance or rejection of input.

The initial development target is an on-screen, touch- and mouse- accessible view, however physical devices such as joysticks would also work, with the right drivers.

Long term users might include those with limited fine motor skills (or MSDs generally?) for whom traditional keyboards are inaccessible; users of smartwatches, and perhaps even smartphone users.

WARNING: This software is an early alpha. Everything may change.
